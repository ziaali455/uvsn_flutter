  - Note: Mean RGB values: R=___, G=___, B=___
  - Note: Chromaticity: r=___, g=___
- [ ] Process with Python (toggle ON)
  - Note: Mean RGB values: R=___, G=___, B=___
  - Note: Chromaticity: r=___, g=___
- [ ] Values match (within rounding tolerance) ‚úÖ

**Test Image 2: DNG/RAW (if available)**
- [ ] Process with Flutter (toggle OFF)
  - Result: _______________
- [ ] Process with Python (toggle ON)
  - Result: _______________
- [ ] Python handles formats Flutter can't ‚úÖ

### Error Handling

- [ ] Upload unsupported file format
  - [ ] Error message displays appropriately
- [ ] Upload corrupted image
  - [ ] Error message displays appropriately
- [ ] Turn off Python API while toggle is ON
  - [ ] Upload image
  - [ ] Error message displays
  - [ ] App doesn't crash

## üöÄ Deployment Testing

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] All local tests pass

### Vercel Deployment

- [ ] Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
- [ ] Login: `vercel login`
- [ ] Deploy: `vercel --prod`
- [ ] Deployment succeeds without errors
- [ ] Note deployment URL: _______________

### Production Testing

- [ ] Visit deployment URL
- [ ] Flutter app loads correctly
- [ ] Cloud toggle appears (Python API is available)
- [ ] Test image upload with Flutter processing (toggle OFF)
- [ ] Test image upload with Python API (toggle ON)
- [ ] Both processing modes work
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] No console errors

### API Endpoint Testing

- [ ] Test health check: `curl https://your-project.vercel.app/`
- [ ] Returns OK status
- [ ] Test analyze endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -F "file=@test.jpg" https://your-project.vercel.app/api/analyze
  ```
- [ ] Returns JSON with analysis results

## üìä Performance Testing

### Small Images (< 1MB)

- [ ] Flutter processing time: ___ seconds
- [ ] Python API processing time: ___ seconds
- [ ] Both complete in reasonable time

### Medium Images (1-5MB)

- [ ] Flutter processing time: ___ seconds
- [ ] Python API processing time: ___ seconds
- [ ] Both complete in reasonable time

### Large Images (> 5MB)

- [ ] Flutter processing time: ___ seconds
- [ ] Python API processing time: ___ seconds
- [ ] Note any performance issues

### RAW Files (if available)

- [ ] DNG file size: ___
- [ ] Flutter result: _______________
- [ ] Python API result: _______________
- [ ] Python handles better ‚úÖ

## üêõ Known Issues to Check

## ‚ú® Final Checks

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Both processing modes work
- [ ] Toggle switches smoothly
- [ ] Error handling is graceful
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Ready for production use

## üì∏ Test Images Needed

Prepare these test images:

1. **Standard JPG** (< 1MB)
   - Should work with both Flutter and Python
   - Use for comparison testing

2. **Large JPG** (> 5MB)
   - Test performance with both methods

3. **PNG with transparency**
   - Verify both handle transparency

4. **DNG file** (if available)
   - Preferably with compression type 7
   - Test Python's enhanced RAW support

5. **Image with EXIF data**
   - Verify EXIF extraction works
   - Check photographic calculations (S_v, A_v, T_v, B_v)

## üéØ Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Python API runs locally without errors
- ‚úÖ Flutter app runs locally without errors
- ‚úÖ Toggle between processing modes works
- ‚úÖ Both modes produce accurate results
- ‚úÖ Python handles formats Flutter can't
- ‚úÖ Deployment to Vercel succeeds
- ‚úÖ Production app works correctly
- ‚úÖ Documentation is clear and complete

## üìû If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check console output** for error messages
2. **Review logs** in terminal
3. **Verify dependencies** are installed
4. **Restart services** (API and Flutter app)
5. **Check DEPLOYMENT.md** troubleshooting section
6. **Review PYTHON_API_SUMMARY.md** for architecture details
